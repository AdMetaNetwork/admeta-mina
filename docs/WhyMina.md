# Why Mina?

AdMeta is a decentralized advertising protocol focused on meeting the needs between users and advertisers. In order to protect user privacy, AdMeta uses zk to complete the verification of user identity information and apply it to the matching of advertising algorithms. AdMeta needs to support different blockchain networks at the same time to meet the needs of project parties and users in different ecosystems.

Therefore, Mina is a very ideal solution for AdMeta. By integrating o1js, we can use Mina to complete zk proof of user information, and also meet the cross-chain needs of AdMeta.

We plan to expand our current data model in Mina in the future and improve our user interaction experience so that we can make full use of Mina while also giving users the best experience.
